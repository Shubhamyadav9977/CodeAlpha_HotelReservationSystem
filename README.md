The Hotel Reservation System is a Java-based project that allows users to search, book, and manage hotel rooms. It provides an easy-to-use interface (console or GUI) to simulate real-world hotel operations such as booking rooms, canceling reservations, and viewing booking details.

✨ Features

🔍 Search & Book Rooms – Users can check available rooms and make reservations.

🛏 Room Categorization – Standard, Deluxe, and Suite room types.

📅 Manage Reservations – Make or cancel bookings with unique reservation IDs.

💳 Payment Simulation – Simple payment confirmation during booking.

📖 View Booking Details – Display all reservations with customer and room details.

⚙️ Backend Logic – Built using Java OOP concepts with ArrayList / File I/O for data management.

Hotel.java → Room details & availability.

Reservation.java → Reservation details (customer name, ID, dates, room type).

HotelReservationSystem.java → Main application logic (booking, canceling, viewing).

🎯 Future Enhancements

🖥 Shift from console → full GUI with Swing/JavaFX.

🌐 Add database support (MySQL/SQLite).
